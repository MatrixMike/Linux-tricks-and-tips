Brasero install on XUbuntu

My laptop was good to play CD and DVD and I tried to copy a CD recently using the same laptop with some success after brasero detecting that some library files were missing which it could automatically (I recall) install itself (i.e. with something like a few clicks).

I tried today to make a DVD copy and Brasero informed me that : "All required applications and libraries are not installed."
I was told  :"Please install the following manually and try again:
libdvdcss.so.2 (library)
libdvdcss.so.2 (library)."

The question was/is how and where from. This issue occurs often with linux and this time I attempt to document and share my experience.
